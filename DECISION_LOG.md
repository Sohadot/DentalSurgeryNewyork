# Decision Log

## 2026-05-11 — Borough Decision Layer (Sprint 7)

**Decision:** Replace shallow borough location pages with comprehensive 11-section patient decision guides for all five NYC boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island). Strengthen the `/locations` hub page.

**Rationale:** The original borough pages (~40 lines each) provided minimal local context. The Inevitable Reference Strategy requires borough-specific infrastructure that meaningfully differentiates each borough's access logistics, procedure complexity framing, cost context, emergency boundaries, and consultation checklists. Shallow content does not serve that objective.

**Governance alignment:** All five borough pages comply with `COMMERCIALIZATION_POSTURE.md`:
- No named practices
- No rankings
- No "best oral surgeon" language
- No unsupported pricing claims
- Partner visibility bridge sentence appears once per page, at the end, after all editorial content
- Emergency sections do not encourage price-shopping

**Content structure per borough page:**
1. Borough decision context
2. Access and follow-up considerations
3. Procedure complexity context (all 6 procedure types addressed)
4. Cost context with cautious language
5. When to search beyond the borough
6. Emergency boundaries
7. Borough consultation checklist
8. Related procedure links
9. Related cost links
10. Editorial note
11. Light partner visibility bridge

**Internal linking note:** Borough pages link only to routes that exist in this version of `lib/content-index.ts`. Routes for tooth extraction, bone grafting, oral surgery sedation, and emergency oral surgery procedures/costs are referenced in prose but not linked, as those routes are not yet present in the local route registry.

**Borough Decision Layer added to strengthen New York-specific reference depth and support the Inevitable Reference strategy.**

No new routes added. All 27 routes validate and build cleanly.

## 2026-05-10 — Procedure Hub and Cost Decision Layer (Sprint 3)

**Decision:** Build the `/procedures` hub page and add four cost guide pages (tooth extraction, bone grafting, oral surgery sedation, emergency oral surgery).

**Rationale:** Each artifact serves dual purposes:

1. **Reference function** — The procedure hub provides indexed access to all six procedure areas from a single navigational surface. Cost guide pages give patients a structured way to interpret pricing before consultation.
2. **Commercial inventory** — Each cost guide page is a potential procedure-level sponsorship slot (cost layer) governed by `COMMERCIALIZATION_POSTURE.md`. The Reference Partner tier now explicitly includes cost guide visibility as a distinct placement surface.

**Governance alignment:** All new pages comply with `COMMERCIALIZATION_POSTURE.md`:
- No lead forms
- No unnamed or fake practices
- All pricing figures published as directional context, not quotes
- Practice visibility uses the standardized single-paragraph note
- No clinical superiority claims

**Route registration:** Five new routes registered in `lib/content-index.ts`: `/procedures` (hub), `/costs/tooth-extraction`, `/costs/bone-grafting`, `/costs/oral-surgery-sedation`, `/costs/emergency-oral-surgery`.

**Navigation:** Primary nav "Procedures" link updated from `/procedures/dental-implants` to the `/procedures` hub, so the first nav click lands on a page that indexes all six procedure areas.

**Commercial tier update:** Reference Partner tier includes updated to reflect visibility on cost guide pages as a distinct surface alongside procedure and borough pages. Category Sponsor description updated to surface cost guide as a sponsorable category.

**Commercial tier alignment:**
- `/costs/tooth-extraction` → eligible for procedure sponsorship at the Verified/Reference tier
- `/costs/bone-grafting` → eligible for procedure sponsorship at the Reference/Category tier (high implant-adjacent value)
- `/costs/oral-surgery-sedation` → eligible for procedure sponsorship at the Reference tier
- `/costs/emergency-oral-surgery` → eligible for procedure sponsorship at the Reference tier (high urgency intent)

## 2026-05-10 — Procedure Inventory Expansion (Sprint 2)

**Decision:** Expand the oral surgery procedure inventory from 2 pages (dental implants, wisdom tooth removal) to 6 pages by adding tooth extraction, bone grafting, oral surgery sedation, and emergency oral surgery.

**Rationale:** Each additional procedure page serves dual purposes:

1. **Reference function** — Provides independent, patient-first decision guidance on a high-demand oral surgery topic for New York patients.
2. **Commercial inventory** — Each procedure page is a potential procedure-level sponsorship slot governed by `COMMERCIALIZATION_POSTURE.md`. No commercial language was introduced into editorial content; the only commercial signal is the standardized "Practice Visibility" note linking to `/partners`.

**Governance alignment:** All four pages comply with `COMMERCIALIZATION_POSTURE.md`:
- No lead forms
- No fake or unnamed practices
- No "best surgeon" or superiority claims
- No clinical promises
- Practice visibility is disclosed via a standardized single-paragraph note, not embedded advertising

**Internal linking:** Cross-links added between all procedure pages to strengthen the reference network and reduce bounce for high-intent users navigating between related topics. Existing pages (dental implants, wisdom tooth removal) updated to link to the new procedure surfaces.

**Commercial tier alignment:**
- `tooth-extraction` → eligible for borough or procedure sponsorship at the Verified/Reference tier
- `bone-grafting` → eligible for procedure sponsorship at the Reference/Category tier (high implant-adjacent value)
- `oral-surgery-sedation` → eligible for procedure sponsorship at the Reference tier
- `emergency-oral-surgery` → eligible for procedure sponsorship at the Reference tier (high urgency intent)

## 2026-05-10 — Commercialization Layer Opened (Sprint 1)

**Decision:** Establish the commercial governance framework and open the Partner Practice Program as a live page.

**Artifacts created:**
- `COMMERCIALIZATION_POSTURE.md` — internal governance document
- `/partners` page — public-facing partner program with three tiers
- `data/partner-schema.ts` — typed schema for future partner directory
- Navigation and footer updated to surface the partner program
